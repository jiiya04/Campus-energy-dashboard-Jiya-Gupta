Energy Dashboard
-----------------------------------

Project: Campus Energy Dashboard

1) Total campus energy (covered period)
---------------------------------------
Total campus energy (sum of kWh in cleaned data): 75.00 kWh

2) Highest-consuming building
-----------------------------
Building with highest total consumption: buildingA
Total energy for that building: 75.00 kWh

3) Peak day (highest single-day campus consumption)
---------------------------------------------------
Date with highest campus consumption: 2024-03-02
Campus kWh on that day: 38.00 kWh

4) Simple observations / notes
------------------------------
- Data source: all CSV files placed in the `data/` folder and merged by `ingest.py`.
- Time resolution: original readings may be hourly; aggregation here is daily.
- Missing or invalid rows were dropped during ingestion and recorded in `output/ingestion_log.txt`.
- Building names (if missing) were inferred from filenames where possible.

5) Suggestions
-----------------------------------
- Add more months of raw CSVs to increase analysis period.
- Create weekly and monthly trend charts to show longer-term patterns.
- Flag unusually high single-day or single-hour spikes for investigation.
